# üêõ Bug Fix - Provider Self-Booking Prevention

## Problem Description

**Issue**: A provider could see booking and messaging buttons on their own services and profile, allowing them to potentially book or message themselves.

**Impact**: 
- Poor user experience
- Confusing interface
- Potential for accidental self-bookings
- Unnecessary contact options

---

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made

#### 1. ServiceDetails Page
**File**: `src/pages/ServiceDetails.jsx`

**Before**:
- Booking and message buttons always visible
- No check for service ownership

**After**:
- Added conditional rendering based on user ID
- Hide booking/message buttons if `user.id === provider.user_id`
- Show "Edit Service" button for own services
- Display "C'est votre service" message

**Code Changes**:
```jsx
{/* Only show booking buttons if NOT the provider's own service */}
{user?.id !== provider?.user_id && (
  <>
    <button onClick={handleBookNow}>R√©server maintenant</button>
    <button>Envoyer un message</button>
  </>
)}

{/* Show edit button for provider's own service */}
{user?.id === provider?.user_id && (
  <div>
    <p>C'est votre service</p>
    <button>Modifier mon service</button>
  </div>
)}
```

#### 2. ProviderProfile Page
**File**: `src/pages/ProviderProfile.jsx`

**Before**:
- Contact buttons (Call, WhatsApp, Email) always visible
- No check for profile ownership

**After**:
- Added `useAuth` hook import
- Added conditional rendering based on user ID
- Hide contact buttons if `user.id === provider.user_id`
- Show "Edit Profile" button for own profile
- Display "C'est votre profil" message

**Code Changes**:
```jsx
{/* Only show contact buttons if NOT viewing own profile */}
{user?.id !== provider?.user_id ? (
  <>
    <a href={`tel:${provider.phone}`}>Appeler</a>
    <a href={whatsappLink}>WhatsApp</a>
    <a href={`mailto:${provider.email}`}>Email</a>
  </>
) : (
  <div>
    <p>C'est votre profil</p>
    <Link to="/edit-profile">Modifier mon profil</Link>
  </div>
)}
```

## Technical Details

- Edit buttons for own content
- Cleaner interface for providers
