# Signup Logout Issue - Fix Documentation

## Problem Identified
Users were getting logged out immediately after creating an account. This was caused by a timing issue where the profile was being queried before it was fully committed to the database.

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**

### **Issue:**
1. User creates account
2. Auth user created ✅
3. Profile inserted into database ✅
4. Profile query executed immediately ❌
5. Profile not found (database not committed yet)
6. Error thrown → User set to null → Logged out

### **Timing Problem:**
```
Create Auth User → Insert Profile → Query Profile
                                    ↑
                              Too fast! Profile not committed yet
```

---

## ✅ **Solution Implemented:**

### **1. Added Delay After Profile Creation**
```javascript
// Wait for database to commit
console.log('⏳ Waiting for database commit...')
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
```

### **2. Added Retry Logic**
```javascript
let retries = 3
let profileLoaded = false

while (retries > 0 && !profileLoaded) {
  try {
    await loadUserProfile(userId)
    profileLoaded = true
  } catch (error) {
    retries--
    if (retries > 0) {
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
    } else {
      throw error
    }
  }
}
```

### **3. Fixed Error Handling**
```javascript
// Don't set user to null during signup - let retry logic handle it
throw error // Instead of setUser(null)
```

---

## 🔧 **Changes Made:**

### **File: `src/context/AuthContext.jsx`**

**Change 1: Added Wait Time**
- Added 1-second delay after profile creation
- Allows database to commit changes
- Ensures profile is available for query

**Change 2: Retry Logic**
- 3 retry attempts
- 1-second delay between retries
- Logs each attempt
- Only fails after all retries exhausted

**Change 3: Error Handling**
- Don't clear user state on error during signup
- Let retry logic handle temporary failures
- Only fail if all retries exhausted

## 🔐 **Supabase Configuration:**

### **RLS Policies (Already Correct):**

**Profiles Table:**
```sql
-- SELECT: Everyone can view
CREATE POLICY "profiles_select_all"
  ON public.profiles
  FOR SELECT
  USING (true);

-- INSERT: Users can insert own profile
CREATE POLICY "profiles_insert_own"
  ON public.profiles
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);
```

**Provider Profiles Table:**
```sql
-- SELECT: Everyone can view
CREATE POLICY "provider_profiles_select_all"
  ON public.provider_profiles
  FOR SELECT
  USING (true);

-- INSERT: Users can insert own provider profile
CREATE POLICY "provider_profiles_insert_own"
  ON public.provider_profiles
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```
