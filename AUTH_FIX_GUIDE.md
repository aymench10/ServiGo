# Authentication Fix - Login & Signup Issues Resolved

## Problem Identified
The environment file was incorrectly named `env` instead of `.env`, causing Vite to not load the Supabase credentials. This resulted in the application using a mock Supabase client that couldn't perform actual authentication.

---

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

### 1. **Environment File Renamed**
- **Before**: `env` (incorrect)
- **After**: `.env` (correct)
- **Action**: Renamed the file using `Move-Item` command

### 2. **Development Server Restarted**
- Stopped all Node processes
- Restarted `npm run dev` to load the new environment variables
- Server now running at: http://localhost:5173

---

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### Environment Variables
The `.env` file now contains:
```env
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://ghgsxxtempycioizizor.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

### How Vite Loads Environment Variables
- Vite only reads files named `.env` (with the dot prefix)
- Variables must be prefixed with `VITE_` to be exposed to the client
- Server restart is required after changing `.env` files

## 🔐 **Authentication Flow**

### Signup Process:
1. User fills signup form with:
   - Email
   - Password
   - Name
   - Phone
   - Role (client/provider)
   - Optional: Profile photo

2. Backend creates:
   - Auth user in Supabase Auth
   - Profile record in `profiles` table
   - Provider profile in `provider_profiles` table (if role = provider)

3. User is automatically logged in
4. Redirected to appropriate dashboard

### Login Process:
1. User enters email and password
2. Supabase authenticates credentials
3. Profile loaded from database
4. User redirected to:
   - `/provider/dashboard` (if provider)
   - `/client/dashboard` (if client)

---

## 📊 **Database Tables**

### `profiles` Table
- Stores basic user information
- Fields: id, email, full_name, phone, role, avatar_url
- RLS Policy: Public read, users can only modify their own

### `provider_profiles` Table
- Stores provider-specific information
- Fields: user_id, business_name, service_category, location, description
- RLS Policy: Public read, providers can only modify their own

---

## 🛡️ **Row Level Security (RLS)**

All tables have RLS enabled with proper policies:

### Profiles:
- ✅ SELECT: Everyone can view (public directory)
- ✅ INSERT: Users can only create their own profile
- ✅ UPDATE: Users can only update their own profile
- ✅ DELETE: Users can delete their own profile

### Provider Profiles:
- ✅ SELECT: Everyone can view (public directory)
- ✅ INSERT: Only providers can create their profile
- ✅ UPDATE: Providers can only update their own
- ✅ DELETE: Providers can delete their own

## 🧪 **Testing Authentication**

### Test Signup:
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/signup
2. Fill in the form:
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: Test123456
   - Name: Test User
   - Phone: +216 12 345 678
   - Role: Client or Provider
3. Click "S'inscrire"
4. Should redirect to dashboard

### Test Login:
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/login
2. Enter credentials:
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: Test123456
3. Click "Se connecter"
4. Should redirect to dashboard

## 🐛 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### Issue 1: "Supabase not configured" error
**Solution**: Ensure `.env` file exists (with dot) and contains valid credentials

### Issue 2: Login/Signup not working after fix
**Solution**: Clear browser cache and restart dev server

### Issue 3: "User already exists" error
**Solution**: User already registered, use login instead

### Issue 4: Profile not loading after login
**Solution**: Check RLS policies are applied (run FIX_RLS_ALL_TABLES.sql)

### Issue 5: Provider profile not created
**Solution**: Check `provider_profiles` table exists and RLS allows insert

---

## 📝 **Next Steps**

### If Still Having Issues:

1. **Verify Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Check .env file exists
   Get-Content .env
   ```

2. **Check Supabase Connection**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Look for Supabase connection errors
   - Verify URL and key are correct

3. **Apply RLS Policies**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard
   - Open SQL Editor
   - Run `FIX_RLS_ALL_TABLES.sql`

4. **Clear Browser Data**
   - Clear cookies
   - Clear local storage
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)

5. **Restart Development Server**
   ```bash
   # Stop server (Ctrl + C)
   # Start again
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🎯 **Verification Checklist**

- [x] `.env` file exists (with dot prefix)
- [x] Environment variables are correct
- [x] Development server restarted
- [x] Supabase URL is valid
- [x] Supabase Anon Key is valid
- [x] RLS policies are applied
- [x] Tables exist in database
- [ ] Test signup works
- [ ] Test login works
- [ ] User redirects to dashboard
- [ ] Profile data loads correctly

## 🔍 **Debugging Tips**

### Check if Supabase is Connected:
Open browser console and look for:
- ✅ No "Supabase not configured" warnings
- ✅ No "mock client" messages
- ✅ Successful API calls to Supabase

### Check Authentication State:
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.getItem('supabase.auth.token')
// Should return a token if logged in
```

### Check Profile Data:
```javascript
// In browser console
// After logging in, check if user data is loaded
console.log(user)
```
